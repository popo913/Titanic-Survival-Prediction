# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
It is a project aiming to create a machine learning model that is trained to accurately predict whether a passenger survived the titanic disaster.The dataset used is the Titanic dataset ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file"). 
The datset contains features like age,gender,ticket class,fare,cabin information etc. 
The model is capable of handling missing values and encode categorical variables and normalize data effectively.</br>
<h2>TASK OBJECTIVES</h2><hr>
•Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. </br>
•Dataset includes features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin information etc.</br> 
• Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data effectively.</br>
• Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, etc.</br>
• Expected outcome: A well-trained classification model with strong survival prediction accuracy.</br>

# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
It is a project aiming to create a machine learning model that is trained to accurately predict whether a passenger survived the titanic disaster.The dataset used is the <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file">"Titanic dataset"</a>. 
The datset contains features like age,gender,ticket class,fare,cabin information etc. 
The model is capable of handling missing values and encode categorical variables and normalize data effectively.</br>
<h2>TASK OBJECTIVES</h2><hr>
•Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. </br>
•Dataset includes features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin information etc.</br> 
• Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data effectively.</br>
• Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, etc.</br>
• Expected outcome: A well-trained classification model with strong survival prediction accuracy.</br>
<h2>STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT</h2><hr>
<ol><li>Install the required libraries and extensions sucha as pandas etc.</li>
<li>Prepare the dataset i.e titanic dataset , find the path and documentation of the dataset. We then determine features of the dataset. I used Google Colab for making the project so i uploaded the downloaded dataset "tested.csv" onto Google Colab.</li>
<li>Code the needed program to train the model and then rum the script.</li>
<li>If the code is correct ,data is properly loaded then we expect the following:</li>
<ol>
  <li>Preprocessing of data</li>
  <li>Training therandom model on the dataset</li>
  <li>Display perfomance metrics like accuracy,F1 score etc</li>
  <li>Save the trained model.</li>
</ol>
